# PyBer Analyization

### Overview
My job ws to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create an intricate visualization for our CEO of PyBer, V. Isualize.

### Results

As you can see, Urban fares are much higher at any given point then both Suburban and Rural fares. This makes sense in a capitalistic country where there are more people in Urban environments so you can charge more. Overall; Urban has higher fares, more riders, and more drivers, followed by Suburban and finally Rural

### Summary
Based on the results of my analyzation, I feel the need to recommend to lower Urban fares and raise the Rural fares. Generally, the fares should be close to equal but Urban fares should be cheaper as it is less space to cover and more customers.
